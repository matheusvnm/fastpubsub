# Introduction

We are developing a framework for working with Google PubSub called StarConsumers.
We move it to the `old/` directory, since we will need to reimplement it from scratch.
The reason is that we found a new framework called Faststream.  It has capabilities 
that are similiar to the framework we are creating plus some new ones. 

However, the Google PubSub support it has is poor and lacks the Google's APIs features.

You can see the he capabilities related to the Starconsumers and Faststream the respective,
`02.starconsumers.md` and `03.faststream.md` files. Feel free to explore the files of both projects 
(`old/` and `faststream/`, respectively) to get more context.


The task we need to do is to create a version of StarConsumers that adds some of the selected Faststream 
features in the code while keeping the features of StarConsumers. 
For that there is a file called `04.tasks.md` that describe what to do in details.
Read it after you read `02.starconsumers.md`, `03.faststream.md` and the projects file to get more context.
